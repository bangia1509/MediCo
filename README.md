# MediCo Application

The app MediCo is designed to make Doctorâ€“Patient relationship better, easier and less tedious. 
This application will have 2 portals, one for the doctor and one for the patient. Doctors can update the 
medical diagnosis and medication of each of their patients and this will be updated to the database, and 
hence will be visible to the respective patients. Patients can also book an appointment with their desired
doctor, and then the doctor can choose whether to accept or not. This app can come handy for those 
doctors who run independent clinics and are still dependent on large amounts of paper work for each 
patient. The purpose behind this app is to make the whole process simpler and save a lot of paper in the 
process.
